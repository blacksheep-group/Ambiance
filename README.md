# Ambiance


## Project Description

Ambiance is an air quality monitoring system developed by PUP Hygears for the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. It boasts a user-friendly interface tailored to operate seamlessly on a Raspberry Pi 4. Utilizing Lorawan technologies, data from ESP32-connected sensors is efficiently transmitted for comprehensive analysis and real-time monitoring.

## Sensors:

1. Adafruit BME680
    - Temperature 
    - Pressure
    - Humidity
    - Biogenic Volatile Organic Compound (Gas Sensor)

2. Adafruit SGP30
    - Total Volatile Organic Compound
    - ECO<sub>2</sub>

3. Plantower PMS7003
    - PM 1.0
    - PM 2.5
    - PM 10.0

5. Connect the pins to the board. *(Note: Ambiance was designed for the ESP32, so the pin configurations may differ for your specific board.)*:
    | Sensor               |  Pin Label (I2C) | Pin Number (Default) |
    |--------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
    | Adafruit BME680      | VCC              | VIN                  |
    |                      | GND              | GND                  |
    |                      | SCK              | 22                   |
    |                      | SDI              | 21                   |
    | Adafruit SGP30       | VCC              | VIN                  |

## LoRa Initializaation
1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:	

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/marvinjameserosa/ambiance.git

    ```
    cd \Ambiance\sketch-files\lora-receiver
    ```

4. Install project dependencies using Library Manager
    ```
    LoRa by Sandeep Mistry
    ```
4. Connect the pins to the board. Pins are same for both Sender and Receiver.  *(Note: Ambiance was designed for the ESP32, so the pin configurations may differ for your specific board.)*:
    |  Pin Label (SPI) | Pin Number (Default)       |
    | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
    | VCC              | VIN                        |
    | GND              | GND                        |
    | MISO             | 19                         |
    | MOSI             | 23                         |
    | SCK              | 18                         |
    | CS               | 17 (any pin can be used)   |
    | RESET            | 14 (any pin can be used)   |
    | G0               | 26 (any pin can be used)   |
5. Upload both the sender and receiver to their respective board.
