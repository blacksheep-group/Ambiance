    - Temperature 
    - Pressure
    - Humidity
    - Biogenic Volatile Organic Compound (Gas Sensor)

2. Adafruit SGP30
    - Total Volatile Organic Compound
    - ECO<sub>2</sub>

3. Plantower PMS7003
    - PM 1.0
    - PM 2.5
    - PM 10.0

    | CS               | 17 (any pin can be used)   |
    | RESET            | 14 (any pin can be used)   |
    | G0               | 26 (any pin can be used)   |
5. Upload both the sender and receiver to their respective board.

## Raspberry Pi Initialization
1. Enable Serial Port in the Raspberry Pi Configuration:
    ```
    start > Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration > Interfaces
    ```
2. Restart the Raspberry Pi.
3. Clone the project repository from GitHub:	
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/marvinjameserosa/ambiance.git  
    ```
4. Navigate to the repository folder:
    ```
    cd ./ambiance
    ```
5. Connect the receiver to the Raspberry Pi
6. Check the corresponding serial port using the command line:
    ```
    python -m serial.tools.miniterm 
    ```
7. In the sensor.py change the constant PORT to the corresponding serial port.
    ```
    PORT = '/dev/ttyACM0' 
    ```
9. Run the web.py.
    ```
    python3 web.py 
    ```
